## What is Quantum Hero?
 _It is Rhythm Game developed for the Quantum Hackathon project._<br>

Using a __quantum channel__ generated by _simulaqron_ the two players __Alice__ and __Bob__ can play together. An entangled note (state) is generated by the server and sent to the two player, then Alice measures one note collapsing the state. At this point Bob knows the measure done by Alice and do the same.
Both players must stay in the rhythm of the music and make measurements in order to violate the Bell's inequality. If at the end of time they managed to break it they win.

## How to play?

```
pip3 install flask matplotlib simulaqron
```

Run the server simulaqron
